Description
===========

USBDeview is a small utility that lists all USB devices that currently
connected to your computer, as well as all USB devices that you
previously used.
For each USB device, extended information is displayed: Device
name/description, device type, serial number (for mass storage devices),
the date/time that device was added, VendorID, ProductID, and more...
USBDeview also allows you to uninstall USB devices that you previously
used, and disconnect USB devices that are currently connected to your
computer.
You can also use USBDeview on a remote computer, as long as you login to
that computer with admin user.

USBDeview doesn't require any installation process or additional DLL
files. Just copy the executable file (USBDeview.exe) to any folder you
like, and run it.
The main window of USBDeview displays all USB devices installed on your
system. You can select one or more items, and then disconnect (unplug)
them , uninstall them, or just save the information into text/xml/html
file.



USBDeview Columns Description
=============================


* Device Name: Specifies the device name. For some device, this column
  may display meaningless name, like "USB Device". If the device name is
  meaningless, try to look at the Description column.
* Device Description: The description of the device.
* Device Type: The device type, according to USB class code. For more
  information about USB classes: USB Class Codes.
* Connected: Specifies whether the device is currently connected to
  your computer. If the device is connected, you can use the 'Disconnect
  Selected Devices' option (F9) to disconnect the device.
* Safe To Unplug: Specifies whether it's safe to unplug the device from
  the USB plug without disconnecting it first. If the value of this
  column is false, and you want to unplug this device, you must first
  disconnect this device by using the 'Disconnect Selected Devices'
  option (F9) of USBDeview utility, or by using the 'Unplug or Eject
  Hardware' utility of Windows operating system.

  column is only relevant to USB flash memory devices and to USB CD/DVD
  drives. Be aware that USBDeview cannot detect drive letters of USB
  hard-disks.
* Serial Number: Specifies the serial number of the device. This column
  is only relevant to mass storage devices (flash memory devices, CD/DVD
  drives, and USB hard-disks).
* Created Date: Specifies the date/time that the device was installed.
  In most cases, this date/time value represents the time that you first
  plugged the device to the USB port. However, be aware that in some
  circumstances this value may be wrong. Also, On Windows 7, this value
  is initialized with the current date/time on every reboot.
* Last Plug/Unplug Date: Specifies the last time that you
  plugged/unplugged the device. This date value is lost when you restart
  the computer.
* VendorID/ProductID: Specifies the VendorID and ProductID of the
  device. For unofficial list of VendorID/ProductID, click here.
* USB Class/Subclass/Protocol: Specifies the Class/Subclass/Protocol of
  the device according to USB specifications. For more information about
  USB classes: USB Class Codes.
* Hub/Port: Specifies the hub number and port number that the device
  was plugged into. This value is empty for mass storage devices.
Notice: According to user reports, On some systems the 'Last Plug/Unplug
Date' and the 'Created Date' values are initialized after reboot. This
means that these columns may display the reboot time instead of the
correct date/time.

speed of your USB flash drive. The test is made by writing a large file
(named $speed_test_nirsoft$.dat) into your USB flash drive, and then
reading it back for testing the read speed. Be aware that you need at
least 100 MB of free disk space in order to successfully make this speed
test. Also, be aware that this test is made with sequential read and
write operations. When using multiple small files, the read/write
performances are usually much lower than sequential read/write.

In order to make a speed test to your flash drive, simply select the
desired item in the main window, and then choose the 'Speed Test' option
from the File menu, or press Ctrl+T. In the speed test window, verify
that the selected drive letter is the right one, and then press the
'Start Test' button. Wait a few seconds until the write and read tests
are finished.



Publishing Your Speed Test Result
=================================

If you want to share your speed test results, so other people that want
to purchase a USB flash drive will be able to easily compare the speed of
different flash drives, you can use the 'Publish Test Result' option to
do that.

When you successfully finish a speed test, the 'Publish Test Result'
button is automatically enabled. Clicking this button opens a new window
that displays all the data that will be sent to
http://usbspeed.nirsoft.net Web site, and ask you the confirm the speed
test publishing. Be aware that only the data displayed in this window is
transmitted to http://usbspeed.nirsoft.net Web site. USBDeview doesn't
send the serial number of your USB device or any other information that
may violate your privacy.



AutoPlay
========

Starting from version 1.10, USBDeview allows you to automatically run a
file on USB flash memory devices, according to AutoRun.inf filename. You
can manually activate the AutoPlay feature by selecting the desired
device and pressing F8. Alternatively, You can check the "AutoPlay When
Device Is Connected" option, and then the AutoPlay feature will be
automatically activated when you insert a USB flash memory device.
Be aware that this feature only works if USBDeview detects the drive
letter of the device.



Execute a command when you insert a USB device
==============================================

Starting from version 1.10, USBDeview allows you to execute a command
from exe/cmd/bat file in every time that insert a USB device to your
system. In order to use this feature, go to 'Options->Advanced Options',
select the 'Execute..' check-box, and type the exe/cmd file that you want
to run. You can also use the following special variables in this command
string: %device_name%, %device_desc%, %drive%, %serial_number%, %vid%,
%pid%, %vid_hex%, %pid_hex% , %device_type%, %service_name%,
%device_class%, %device_mfg%
USBDeview will automatically replace these variables with the appropriate
data of the device that you inserted. For example, if you want to pass to
your exe file 2 parameters - the serial number of the device, and the
drive letter:
c:\temp\test.exe "%serial_number%" "%drive%"



Known Limitations/Issues
========================


* For all devices except 'Mass Storage' Devices: If you plug a device
  to one USB port, and then you plug the same device to another USB port,
  a new record of the same device will be created for each USB port that
  you plug. So if you see multiple lines for exactly the same device, it
  means that you plugged it to different USB ports. The USB ports that
  you plugged are specified in 'Hub/Port' column.
  However, for 'Mass Storage' device, only one record is created for each
  device, even if you plug it to different USB port.
* When a USB device is added/removed on your local computer, UDBDeview
  utility automatically updates the list of USB devices.
  But... If you UDBDeview is connected to a remote computer, the list
  won't refresh automatically when a device is added or removed. You must
  refresh it manually, by pressing F5 key.



Connecting To Remote Computer
=============================

The following command-line options allows you to connect to remote
computers. You must login to the remote computer with admin user in order
to use these options.
* /remote <\\Computer Name>
  Allows you to connect a single remote computer.
  For Example:
  USBDeview.exe /remote \\MyComp
* /remotefile <Computers List File>
  Allows you to connect multiple computers, and view all their USB
  activity in one window. The computers list file should be a simple
  Ascii text file with computer names separated by colon, semicolon,
  space, tab characters or CRLF.
  For Example:
  USBDeview.exe /remotefile "c:\temp\comp.txt"
In order to successfully get full admin access to the remote computer,
read this Blog post: How to connect a remote Windows 7/Vista/XP computer
with NirSoft utilities.



Connecting To external SYSTEM registry file
===========================================

If you have the 'SYSTEM' registry file of external operating system, you
can use the following command-line option to read the USB devices list
from it:
/regfile <SYSTEM Registry File>

For Example:
USBDeview.exe /regfile "c:\temp\regfiles\SYSTEM"
USBDeview.exe /regfile "d:\windows\system32\config\SYSTEM"

This option has some limitations:
* You cannot read a Registry file of Windows XP/2003/Vista from Windows
  2000 Machine.
* USBDeview works in read-only mode. (You cannot uninstall a device
  from external file)



Stop/Disconnect Command-Line Options
====================================


* /stop {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Name>
  Stop/disconnect a USB device by specifying its name or description.
  You don't have to specify the whole name or description. You can also
  specify only a part of the name or description string, and USBDeview
  will identify it. For example, If the device name is 'Kingston
  DataTraveler 2.0', you can simply put 'kingston' or 'DataTraveler' in
  the device name parameter, and USBDeview will disconnect the right
  device. You can also specify the instance ID string of the device.
  If you want that a message/balloon will be displayed after the device
  is disconnected, add the '/showmsg' parameter. (Windows 2000 displays a
  message-box, Windows XP displays a balloon)
  If you want to disconnect a device in a remote computer, specify the
  remote computer name, with \\ prefix. You must login to the remote
  computer with admin rights in order to do that.
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop /showmsg "DVD RW"
  USBDeview.exe /stop "DataTraveler"
  USBDeview.exe /stop \\comp01 "SanDisk Cruzer"
  USBDeview.exe /stop "USB\Vid_1058&Pid_1023\8539583490834690"


* /stop_by_serial {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Serial>
  Similar to /stop command, but instead of specifying a device name, you
  should specify the serial number of the device. Works only with mass
  storage devices.
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_serial ea051261
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_serial /showmsg 876534513


* /stop_by_drive {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <Drive Letter>
  Stop/disconnect a USB device by specifying its drive letter. Works only
  with USB flash drives and CD/DVD devices.
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_drive g:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_drive /showmsg f:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_drive /showmsg \\comp02 t:


* /stop_by_class {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <USB Class;USB
  SubClass;USB Protocol>
  Stop/disconnect a USB device by specifying the class/subclass/protocol
  combination.
  For example, if you want to stop all 'Mass Storage' devices, you should
  specify the following class/subclass/protocol combination: 08;06;50
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_class /showmsg 08;06;50
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_class 03;01;02


* /stop_by_pid {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer} <VendorID;ProductID>
  Stop/disconnect a USB device by specifying the VendorID/ProductID. You
  can specify only the VendorID if you want to disconnect all devices
  with that VendorID.
  Examples:
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_pid /showmsg 13fe;1a00
  USBDeview.exe /stop_by_pid 04f9


* /stop_all {/showmsg} {\\RemoteComputer}
  Stop/disconnect all USB devices currently connected to your computer.





Disable/Enable/Remove Command-Line Options
==========================================

Starting from version 1.20, you can also use the following commands to
disable, enable or remove USB devices from command-line:
* /disable {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Name>

Disable, enable and remove actions require elevation ('Run As
Administrator'). You can use the above command-line options with
elevation by adding /RunAsAdmin to the command, for example:
USBDeview.exe /RunAsAdmin /disable
"USB\Vid_1058&Pid_1023\8539583490834690"



Check if a device is connected/disconnected or enabled/disabled
===============================================================

Starting from version 2.70, you can check whether a device is
connected/disconnected or enabled/disabled by using the following
command-line options:
* /is_connected {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Name>
* /is_connected_by_serial {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Serial>
* /is_connected_by_drive {\\RemoteComputer} <Drive Letter>
* /is_connected_by_class {\\RemoteComputer} <USB Class;USB SubClass;USB
  Protocol>
* /is_connected_by_pid {\\RemoteComputer} <VendorID;ProductID>
* /is_disabled {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Name>
* /is_disabled_by_serial {\\RemoteComputer} <Device Serial>

  Protocol>
* /is_disabled_by_pid {\\RemoteComputer} <VendorID;ProductID>
When using the above commands, USBDeview returns the number of disabled
or connected devices that match the specified string.
For example, the following batch file will display 1 if the device with
serial number 7538957348957398 is connected or 0 if the device is not
connected:
USBDeview.exe /is_connected_by_serial "7538957348957398"
echo %ERRORLEVEL%
