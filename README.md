Repository about PDQ Deploy/Inventory Tools, Utilities, Scripts ...
To Check, Repair, Change ...
This Repo is the root of PDQ Deploy's Repository.
These are my daily Tools to manage 2500 Workstations.

For the moment, i'll add .xml files and tools/scripts, one after another.
Sorry if you want to add everything at once, will see later.
Some parts have been translated into French.

I hope this will serve others.
Can be usefull for Free Version users ):

For all "Check*" packages (except CheckSound, surprise inside), it export an html (or csv) report, 
you need to open the report.. Most of checks come from http://www.nirsoft.net .
I usually put this Package on a Directory in PDQ with the report's path in title.
I just select this second package, Ctrl+C, Windows+R and Ctrl+V, to open it, see Screenshot below.
I just need to automatically open the report once generated. I have not yet figured out how to do that.
